## About the Video Course
Managing a Linux server is one of the most demanding tasks for a system administrator to perform. CentOS 7 is a brand-new version of the CentOS Linux system in the RPM family and is one of the most widely-used operating systems by many organizations across the World. Most server infrastructures are equipped with at least one Linux server that provides many essential services, both in terms of users and the infrastructure itself.
In this course, you will start by exploring the administration tools of CentOS 7 Linux server and implementing some of the most common Linux services. You'll get your hands on CentOS 7's built-in security tool. Next, you will be introduced to the most commonly used services and shown in detail how to implement and deploy a secure and production-grade environment for your organization following the open-source DevOps model. Then, you will start to monitor your infrastructure/server using open-source tools. You will then move on to master virtualization and cloud computing techniques by deploying and configuring IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service). After that, you will work on open-source tools for the configuration and management of multiple nodes. Additionally, you will learn about RAID software-based storage and its advanced configurations.

By the end of this course, you will have learned to monitor servers/infrastructure and master the art of virtualization, cloud computing techniques, configuration management, software-based storage (RAID), and some security tweaks.
